# 8 Queens Kata

The eight queens problem consist is giving all possible combinations resulting of placing eight queens in a chess board so that no two queens threaten each other.

You will find the final test in the `spec` folder. Also, you can see the possible solutions by executing `ruby print_solutions.rb`

As a possible extension of this data, we can suggest the N queens problem which consists of giving all possible combinations resulting of placing N queens in a chess board of NxN so that no two queens threaten each other. N would be given as an input.

Happy coding!
